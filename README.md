Macros keystrokes and maps them to cheat codes

## This is ~10 years old, I do not recall if this one worked. Fork it, get it working, be happy.

Was originally created 10/30/2008. I figured after a decade of sitting in a backup, I could liberate this not-so-interesting codebase.

Application built in Visual Basic 6.0, and will need to be compiled (unless I find the EXE somewhere).

On one side is the key to press, and the right side is the actual cheat code it will activate.

This only works on PC (#masterrace).
